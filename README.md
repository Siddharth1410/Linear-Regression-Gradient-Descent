# Problem statement
Suppose we need to build a hospital to be shared by several cities. We donâ€™t want it to
be too far away from any particular city. The question is where to place the hospital. One
way to decide is to place it such that we minimize the sum of the squared distances from the
hospital to the cities.
# Cost function
\sum_{i=0}^{i=n}\left ( y - y_{i} \right )^{2}
